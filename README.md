MSYS2 Toolchains courtesy of devkitPro CodeMii for developing apps for the Nintendo Wii and other platforms

#### WARNING: Please don't install untested or unknown .wad files that might brick your Wii. Instead, use an emulator such as Dolphin or those suggested by the tutorials.

# Tutorials
The following tutorials may be out of date and efforts have been made to \
correct and update the source directories to account for minor inaccuracies.

These include the following:
 * Programmers Notepad has been updated but `Alt + 1` or `F5` don't work to compile code
 * MSYS2 has been included and should be used instead to run `make` and compile code
 * Microsoft Visual Studio Code could be used as an alternative but MSYS2 is the shell
 * The emulators from examples are missing, to be replaced by Dolphin Beta 5.0-15445 \
   with the Wii Menu re-enabled in Tools -> Perform Online System Update -> United States \
   and Tools -> Load Wii System Menu 4.3U (Requires OpenGL compatible Graphics Card on Windows x64) \
   https://dolphin-emu.org/download/?ref=btn
 * The directories included loosely forms an SDK and Toolchain - without the likes of \
   which it is not feasible to create functional executable apps with.

#### DISCLAIMER: By no means are the instructions in the following tutorials and source as simple as they could possibly be. It assumes prior knowledge of C development and should perhaps be migrated to a more modern language such as Python.

# Future Work
I post this content in this repository for the purpose that it may be of use \
to developers especially of MicroPython and CircuitPython so we can potentially \
get a port of CircuitPython working on the Nintendo Wii. \
